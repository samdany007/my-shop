                   <strong class="flo"> Flowers</strong> are an essential part of the <b>natural world</b>,
                    and humans have revered them for centuries. The first flowers existed 
                    on Earth around <i class="flo"> 140 million years</i> ago and soon became an important
                     food source for pollinating insects. And ever since, we've been
                      fascinated by their beauty, as many flower quotes purport, while 
                      they've become intertwined in our celebrations and day-to-day lives.
